Stripe always expects amounts in the smallest currency unit
âœ… For USD: it must be in cents.
âœ… For INR: it must be in paise.
âœ… For EUR: it must be in cents.

ðŸ‘‰ Stripe does this to avoid floatingâ€‘point errors with money.

Stripe needs a very specific format for each product youâ€™re charging the customer for.

When creating a Stripe Checkout Session (e.g., using stripe.checkout.sessions.create()), you must tell Stripe exactly:

âœ… What products are being purchased
âœ… Their name, price, and quantity
âœ… Currency
âœ… Any additional charges (like delivery)
